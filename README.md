Scrapped due to a lack of motivation and time.

## Game Name: Ridin' the Waves

### Concept
A golf-like game where you would move a boat around by dropping objects near the boat to create waves that push the boat. You would select different sized objects in order to create larger, longer lasting waves. You would need to avoid obstacles and walls in order to prevent your boat from being damaged and destroyed. You win by maneuvering through the level and reaching the goal.

### Mechanics
- Camera Controls: Both move around the level and lock on to the boat.
- Object Dropping: Cycle through a selection of objects and drop them near the boat to generate waves.
- Ocean Behavior: Creates waves to push the boat around using the dropped objects.
- Boat Health: Encorages the player to avoid hazards when maneuvering the level.

### Hazards
- Edges & structures which damages the boat when hit.
- Bombs completely destroy the boat when hit.

### Win Conditions
You win by touching the goal zone at the end of the level. After you get a summary that gives you the drops, the par, and the time.

### Levels
Only one level is currently made, which isn't complete but is playable.
